# ðŸ§  U-Net MRI Reconstruction Project

This project implements a U-Net-based deep learning pipeline for reconstructing MRI images from under-sampled k-space data.  
It is part of a learning project to understand how deep learning can accelerate MRI by reducing scan time.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Simulated k-space data and visualization
- Undersampling masks (line-based, random, center-focused)
- U-Net forward pass test
- IFFT visualization of under-sampled artifacts
- Ready to extend to full training with PyTorch
